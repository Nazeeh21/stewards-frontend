# Stewards

Steward Health Cards

this is a very rudimentary website to show the results 
of the gitcoin stewards. it fetches 2 json files and 
generate cards for each steward.

- no yarn / node needed for now
- no build process needed for now
- no vue/react/tailwind or any else framework needed for now :)
- done with pure vanilla js/html
- scss is getting compiled localy into assets/css/app.css for now.

### Local development environment

Using docker, run the following to boot up a local environment at http://localhost:3000.
